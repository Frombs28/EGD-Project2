  - Grooaann..
  - Hi ho! What are you doing up so late?
  - "Morning. Say, you didn\u2019t happen to see anyone in my room earlier, did you?
    I swear someone was in there\u2026"
  - Another day at the grindstone, eh, @?
  - What do you want?
  - "I don\u2019t like the feeling of this morning. Gives me chills, it does."
  - "We have to get off this boat. The whole crew, they\u2019ve got it out for me,
    I can see it in their eyes."
  - "I thought this was supposed to be a lawless life, out on the high sea? Plundering,
    pirating\u2026 all we do is deliver damn boxes, and on a schedule, too."
  - "I\u2019d give my left hand to be in some gutter in some city somewhere, because
    then at least I\u2019d know where the hell I was!"
  - "The second I step off this boat I\u2019m never getting back on; find me in some
    tavern somewhere, drunk off my ass and lousy with gold."
  - "This is the last time I\u2019ll take orders from some blithering fool. From now
    on, I work for myself and myself alone."
  - Sleep with one eye open, lad. Poseidon knows I will.
  - Alright, have a good rest, and keep your mitts out of my cabin.
  - Another uneventful day in this miserable wooden prison.
  - See you tomorrow, sadly.
  - "Get yourself to bed, kid, and out of my hair. I don\u2019t like you snooping
    around me like this."
  - "Music isn\u2019t going to help on a day like today, @."
  - Cut it out with the songs, will ya? Some of us have a ship to run.
  - Now how do you expect me to keep my eye on the rest of these bastards with all
    that ruckus?
  - "Beautiful, @, but very distracting. Can\u2019t you do that somewhere else?"
  - Really, really not necessary. We just need to keep our heads down and work so
    we can leave sooner.
  - Not in the mood, you've bothered me enough today.
