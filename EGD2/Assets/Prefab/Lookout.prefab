  - Ho!
  - Morning, sir, nothing new to report!
  - Good to see you, Mister @, what are you doing all the way up here?
  - "Been a long night, sir, but I\u2019m doing just fine!"
  - Come up for the view or the company?
  - "It\u2019s a happy day when the minstrel climbs up my wooden tower! Hello!"
  - The open sea sure is exciting! So much to see and learn at every moment!
  - "Say, do you think I\u2019d be any good at schooling? I keep wanting to know more
    about the stars, and I think the Captain\u2019s run out of answers\u2026"
  - "I think, in a couple years, I might try pursuing academia. When you all don\u2019t
    need me anymore, I mean! What do you think?"
  - "Do you ever think about what\u2019s up above the sky?"
  - "Look out there\u2026 over the water. Isn\u2019t it just full to bursting with
    mystery? You should see it up here at night\u2026"
  - "May the stars watch over your slumber\u2026 and I\u2019ll keep an eye on the
    stars!"
  - "Don\u2019t stay up too late, don\u2019t want the quartermaster breathing down
    your neck."
  - "By my estimations, sir, it\u2019ll be an easy night. Enjoy it!"
  - "Watch your step on the way down, it\u2019s quite the fall in the dark."
  - "Hope to see you again tomorrow! Just\u2026 come on up\u2026 whenever\u2026 I\u2019ll..
    be here\u2026"
  - That was fantastic! Many thanks for playing that for me!
  - "What a lovely tune\u2026 only thing I\u2019ve heard for hours is the wind."
  - Your mastery of music never ceases to amaze me, sir.
  - My mood is sufficiently lifted, much appreciated!
  - "Well, I see what the helmsman was talking about, you\u2019re rather good with
    that instrument! A kalimba, was it?"
  - Happy for you to sit up here with me, play some music if you like, but I need
    to keep my eyes ahead and my mouth closed for the time being.
