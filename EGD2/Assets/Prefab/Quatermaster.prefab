  - Tsk, Tsk.
  - "Well, look what the shark\u2019s dragged in!"
  - Restful night? Good, no time to waste.
  - Greetings from above, @.
  - Welcome back to the land of the working.
  - I certainly hope you made the best of your late morning, the rest of us have been
    up since sunrise.
  - "Surely there must be something better than this\u2026 right?"
  - "I have this feeling.. In my gut\u2026 sugar? No\u2026.rum? There\u2019s money
    in trade, but where??"
  - "Hmm.. in the East they trade silk\u2026.. Is that an open market?"
  - "I don\u2019t know about you, but the moment we hit land, I\u2019m getting out
    of this god-forsaken business. There\u2019s barely enough profit to go around."
  - Keeping inventory is a far FAR stretch from Master Trader, let me tell you that.
  - Do try not to sleep so late again, hmm?
  - Rest well.
  - Good work today. Very good.
  - Something wrong? No? Then why are you below deck? You need your strength.
  - "Go ahead, now, @, get some sleep. We\u2019ve got it under control for the night."
  - Do you really need to play that thing right in my ear?
  - Ah, more music. Splendid.
  - "That tune\u2026 it reminds me - never mind that."
  - "You surprise me, @, you\u2019re actually not half bad with that."
  - "Not the time, nor the place. There\u2019s work to be done."
  - If you don't mind, I'm quite busy. Go find somebody else to bother.
